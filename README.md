## Adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost)

### Implementing an adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) in MatLab using decision stumps learned using information gain as the weak learners.

#### I have used AdaBoost to classify the "notorious" handwritten digits problem  described in the machine learning book *Learning From Data* by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, and Hsuan-Tien Lin. 
The training and testing sets can be found [here](http://amlbook.com/data/zip/zip.info).
The test set is notoriously "difficult", and a 2.5% error rate is excellent.
